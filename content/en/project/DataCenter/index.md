Campus data centres have a large number of critical equipment such as computer equipment, server equipment, network equipment and storage equipment. In order to achieve the safe and stable operation of these critical equipment, in addition to uninterrupted power supply, auxiliary systems (such as air conditioning systems, lighting systems and security monitoring systems) are also required to support them. However, due to the lack of attention to the thermal environment of the server room and the lack of awareness of energy saving, there are often unreasonable aspects in the thermal design of campus server rooms, mainly in the form of unreasonable cooling structures and unscientific cooling methods. This project uses ANSYS software to numerically simulate the data centre of Nanjing University of Technology, and through processing means such as velocity and temperature clouds and trace diagrams, the airflow organisation of the existing data centre is obtained, and the data room is simulated from the perspective of the outlet air temperature and the outlet air speed. The results show that the downward and upward airflow method performs better in terms of cooling than the traditional side-feed and side-return method. In addition, the cooling effect of lowering the outlet air temperature is better than that of increasing the outlet air speed in the side-feed and side-return airflow.
