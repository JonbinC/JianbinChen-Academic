I'm a 2nd-year HVAC Master student at Donghua University, advised by [Prof. Yong Li](https://env.dhu.edu.cn/2020/0921/c19728a252356/page.htm). My current research topic is "Research on the response characteristics of triple junction photovoltaic cells under trichromatic laser incidence". I hope to continue my research in the photovoltaic realm based on my knowhow in engineering thermodynamics and architecture.
