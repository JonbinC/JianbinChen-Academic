• Aim: To investigate the operating characteristics of laser power beaming systems in the presence of dynamic errors

• Content: Laser energy transfer systems are often subject to tracking errors when tracking dynamic objects. The focus of this study is to investigate the output profile of a photovoltaic receiver in the presence of tracking errors and to improve the system efficiency by optimizing the photovoltaic receiver circuit structure.
